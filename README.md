# Devkit

Guardrails and consistency for Claude Code.

AI agents are powerful but unpredictable — they skip steps, jump to conclusions, and refactor things you didn't ask them to touch. Devkit enforces deterministic, step-by-step workflows that keep Claude on track: propose one change, measure it, keep or revert, repeat. No freestyling.

Every command follows a defined sequence. Self-improvement loops gate each change behind a metric. Multi-agent commands dispatch the same task to multiple models and consolidate consensus. The result is reproducible, auditable work — not whatever Claude felt like doing.

Works with just Claude. Optionally adds Codex and Gemini for multi-perspective analysis.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/5uck1ess/marketplace.git
/plugin install devkit@5uck1ess-plugins
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check what's available
/devkit:status

# Generate tests for your code
/devkit:test-gen src/parser.ts

# Fix all lint errors automatically
/self:lint --lint "npm run lint" --target src/

# Full PR preparation pipeline
/devkit:pr-ready

# Multi-agent code review (uses whatever CLIs you have)
/tri:review

```

| `devkit:executing` | Execute plans methodically — understand, implement, verify, commit |
| `devkit:writing-tests` | Arrange-act-assert, one behavior per test, test contracts not implementation |
| `devkit:clean-code` | Meaningful names, small functions, single responsibility, flat nesting |
| `devkit:dry` | Rule of Three, when duplication is fine, extracting the right abstraction |

| `devkit:verify` | Output validation checklist before proceeding or reporting completion |

---

## RTK Token Optimization

Devkit includes an optional [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) integration that compresses Bash command output before it reaches the context window — **60-90% token savings** on common operations.

| Operation | Before | After | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Directory listing | ~2,000 tokens | ~400 tokens | 80% |
| Test output | ~25,000 tokens | ~2,500 tokens | 90% |
| Git operations | ~3,000 tokens | ~600 tokens | 80% |
| Search results | ~16,000 tokens | ~3,200 tokens | 80% |

**How it works:** A `PreToolUse` hook rewrites Bash commands through RTK (e.g., `git status` → `rtk git status`). If RTK is not installed, the hook is a no-op — everything works normally, just without compression.

**Install RTK:**
```bash
brew install rtk
```

Verify with `/devkit:status` — RTK will show as installed with version.

## Safety Hooks

Devkit includes a `PreToolUse` hook that automatically protects against dangerous operations. Installed with the plugin — no setup required.

### Blocked (hard stop)

| Pattern | Why |
|---|---|
| `rm -rf /`, `rm -rf ~`, `rm -rf .` | Filesystem destruction |
| `DROP TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`, `TRUNCATE` | Database destruction |
| `DELETE FROM` without `WHERE` | Unbounded data deletion |
| `dd if=... of=/dev/`, `mkfs` | Disk/partition destruction |
| Writing to `.pem`, `.key`, `.p12`, `.pfx` files | Private key overwrite |

### Prompted (asks for confirmation)

| Pattern | Why |
|---|---|
| `git push --force` to main/master | Destroys remote history |
| `git reset --hard` | Discards uncommitted work |
| `git checkout -- .` | Discards all unstaged changes |
| `git clean -f` | Permanently removes untracked files |
| `git branch -D main/master` | Deletes primary branch |
| `chmod -R 777` | World-writable permissions |
| `sudo rm` | Elevated privilege deletion |
| Editing `.env`, credentials, secrets, tokens | May contain sensitive data |

## Presets

Reusable prompt templates in `presets/`. Reference with `--preset`:

```bash
/tri:review --preset security-web
/tri:security --preset security-go
/self:perf --preset react-perf
```

### Included Presets

None yet — `presets/` is reserved for future use.

## Autonomy Flags

Set automatically in each multi-agent command:

| Agent | Flags |
|---|---|
| Claude | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |
| Codex | `/codex:rescue --background` (via [codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc)) or `codex -q` (CLI fallback) |
| Gemini | `/gemini:rescue --background` (via [gemini-plugin-cc](https://github.com/abiswas97/gemini-plugin-cc)) or `-y` (CLI fallback) |

---

## Go CLI Harness

Deterministic orchestration binary — the machine controls the loop, Claude is the body.

```bash
cd src && make build
./bin/devkit --help
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `devkit improve` | Metric-gated iteration loop — one Claude invocation per iteration |
| `devkit feature` | Plan, implement, test, lint — commits only after tests pass |
| `devkit bugfix` | Diagnose, fix, verify — reverts if tests break |
| `devkit refactor` | Analyze, transform, verify — reverts if behavior changes |
| `devkit test-gen` | Generate tests, run, fix failures — iterates until green |
| `devkit review` | Parallel multi-agent code review (Claude + Codex + Gemini) |
| `devkit dispatch` | Send any task to multiple agents, compare outputs |
| `devkit status` | Show all sessions, costs, iteration history |
| `devkit resume` | Pick up a crashed or paused session |

### What it does that plugins can't

- **Exact iteration counts** — Go binary owns the loop, not the LLM
- **Crash recovery** — SQLite state + handoff files survive crashes
- **Hard budget caps** — stops spawning at your dollar limit
- **CI/CD integration** — runs headless, no conversation needed
- **True parallel dispatch** — goroutines, not sequential prompts

### Examples

```bash
# Run 50 improvement iterations overnight, stop at $20
devkit improve --metric "npm test" --iterations 50 --budget 20.00

# Implement a feature with test verification
devkit feature "add JWT auth" --target src/auth/ --test "npm test"

# Fix a bug with automated verification
devkit bugfix "login 500 on plus sign emails" --test "go test ./..."

# Generate tests for a module
devkit test-gen src/parser/ --test "go test ./..."

# Resume a crashed session
devkit resume abc123def456

# Check what happened
devkit status
```

---

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Claude Code (you're already here)

**Optional** (for multi-agent commands):
```bash
# Codex plugin (preferred for tri:* commands)
/plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc
/plugin install codex@openai-codex

# Gemini plugin (preferred for tri:* commands)
/plugin marketplace add abiswas97/gemini-plugin-cc
/plugin install gemini@abiswas97-gemini
```

**CLI fallbacks** (used only if plugins are not installed):
```bash
brew install codex gemini-cli
```

**Optional** (for token optimization):
```bash
brew install rtk
```

Check status with `/devkit:status`.

### Codex Plugin Commands

Installing [codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc) gives you these additional commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/codex:rescue` | Delegate a task to Codex (investigation, fixes, continuation) |
| `/codex:review` | Code review via Codex (compare against base branch) |
| `/codex:adversarial-review` | Adversarial review — Codex actively tries to break your code |
| `/codex:result` | Retrieve results from a background Codex task |
| `/codex:status` | Check status of running Codex tasks |

**Flags:** `--model gpt-5.4` / `gpt-5.4-mini` / `gpt-5.4-nano`, `--effort high`, `--background`, `--wait`, `--resume`, `--fresh`

Devkit's `tri:*` commands use `/codex:rescue --background` for multi-agent dispatch.

### Gemini Plugin Commands

Installing [gemini-plugin-cc](https://github.com/abiswas97/gemini-plugin-cc) gives you these additional commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/gemini:rescue` | Delegate a task to Gemini (investigation, fixes, continuation) |
| `/gemini:review` | Code review via Gemini |
| `/gemini:adversarial-review` | Adversarial review — Gemini challenges design decisions |
| `/gemini:result` | Retrieve results from a background Gemini task |
| `/gemini:status` | Check status of running Gemini tasks |

Devkit's `tri:*` commands use `/gemini:rescue --background` for multi-agent dispatch.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for full details.

- [ ] Go CLI harness for deterministic loop control, process management, and unattended runs (see `src/TODO.md`)
- [ ] Cost event hooks — budget threshold events with auto-downgrade actions
- [ ] Execution registry — centralized step tracking with timing and token usage
- [ ] Preset library — curated prompt templates for common review/improvement scenarios
